# React Movie List

A simple web app that can display a list of movies and display the details, which are taken from [The Movie Database (TMDB) API](https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs).
Built on React + Vite + Typescript.

## Features

- Movie list: displays a list of movies

If you are developing a production application, we recommend updating the configuration to enable type aware lint rules:
